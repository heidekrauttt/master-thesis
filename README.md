Open repository containing the code for my Master thesis in Digital Humanities at the University of Stuttgart. <br>

## Abstract
The digital world is ever expanding, its realms stretch into more and more areas of our daily lives. Consumers of digital media value the immersion, the break from reality, that these digitized worlds are able to provide. However, even in the digital, we cannot escape all of the implicit structures of our society. In this thesis, the influence of gender on video games will be investigated. Incorporating gender theories and game studies, a corpus of video game dialogue will be analyzed and parallels will be drawn to the real world. Using a mixture of established corpus linguistics methods, emotion and sentiment analysis with a state-of-the-art transformer model, and a close reading approach, the characters' performance of gender through their speech will be evaluated. 
The study shows that characters of different genders behave differently, choosing different vocabulary and displaying an array of emotions and sentiments. Overall, male characters dominate the corpus, across subsections such as subgenre or target group. Most games have some diverse character representation, however it is marginal in comparison.
The findings of this study will provide a solid foundation for further research and will offer valuable insights into the portrayal of masculinity and diverse characters in video games.

## Introduction
The master thesis that this repository is part of had the title 'Unveiling the Masc: A corpus analysis of masculinity video game dialogue'. The Master thesis is a part of the study program [Digital Humanities](https://www.ilw.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/digital-humanities) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. <br>
In the thesis, I wanted to assess how masculinity is represented in video game dialogue. Video games are a place that modern media often associates with game bros, toxic masculinity, and a general dominance of violent, ultra-muscular male characters. But is that actually true?<br>
I decided to use an already labeled [corpus of video game dialogue](https://github.com/seannyD/VideoGameDialogueCorpusPublic) that was self-inflating and contained dialogue from 50 RPG's. The data was labeled by the speaker's gender and contained metadata such as target group and release year. Not all games were scrapable from the source, and some of the scraped data files had incomplete gender labeling or did not contain any dialogue yet, since the corpus is still growing. In the end, I was left with 19 games that were analyzable. I wanted to investigate gender, particularly masculinity in games. I thus chose to follow a Connellian approach to masculinities; this is a prominent gender studies' theory that argues that multiple masculinities exist. These contain a hegemonic ideal, and other forms of masculinity support and validate the dominance of the hegemony. Persons of other genders are subordinated in the structure. <br>
This framework allowed me to examine masculinities as a multiple, and stay open to different character representations. Because the corpus labeled the character's genders into the groups female, male, and diverse, it was also possible to take a deeper look at diverse character representation. Queer and diverse characters often are neglected in statistical analyses, since their set of data is frequently marginal. However, not investing time and resources into queer studies repeats the current system, which after J. Butler is one of the levers of valdating it. I therefore placed emphasis on also looking at the diverse characters in this data set, their representation and their roles in the game. <br>
This repository contains the Python code that was used for my thesis, the 'data' folder is not available publicly. Interested parties can download it themselves following the instructions on the [corpus website](https://github.com/seannyD/VideoGameDialogueCorpusPublic). 

## Methods
In order to assess masculinities in game dialogue, the master thesis implemented multiple methods. 
[This script](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/scripts/run_basic_analysis.py) runs the complete analysis, including a generation of most of the plots. Further plots can be created using the [postprocessing script](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/scripts/postprocessing.py). <br>
All plots can be found in the [results](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/tree/main/results) section. <br>
Some example results are shown in the following.

### Corpus Analysis
As a first step when analyzing a corpus, a corpus analysis should be employed. As a primary step, the data should be investigated. The following plot shows the percentage that each gender group speaks over the whole of the dialogue, separated by years. It is visible that the male characters speak the most, some years female characters get around 50% speaking time, and diverse characters unfortunately make up only a small portion of the dialogue.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/corpus_analysis/percentage_dialogue_over_time.png" alt="dialogue-over-time" width="600"/><br>
This second visualization shows how many lines are in the corpus per year, and it is very clearly visible that the later years permitted much bigger games, resulting in way more dialogue. One of the key contributing factors is the 'Persona' series, which has by far the largest amount of dialogue per game. In the corpus there are three of the series' games. The newest games are clearly marked in this overview (2008, 2016) due to their size. <br>

#### Word Clouds
In my case, since I graduate from DH, word clouds can't be missed in the thesis, even though their analysis is not the most objective endeavour. I decided to plot wordclouds for each gender group, and first investigated the whole corpus. After that, I zoomed in and only looked at verbs, then at adjectives.
Find [all wordclouds here](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/tree/main/results/corpus_analysis/wordclouds). <br>
<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/corpus_analysis/wordclouds/wordcloud-fem.png" alt="wordcloud-fem" width="600"/> <br>
This is an example wordcloud, for female dialogue of the whole corpus. Overall, this wordcloud is dominated by conversational and introspective terms. The collection of  words such as \textit{need, oh, really, yeah, well, thought}, and \textit{believe}, points towards dialogue centered around emotions, opinions and internal states. The dialogue seems to be reflective, and not as action-driven. Many expressions of thought and filler words are also present, which can be interpreted as the character having a natural conversation, seemingly speaking while talking, which can make them more relatable. <br>

The distinct vocabulary for the three gendered groups show some key differences: the diverse characters seem to have the most narrative and physical dialogue. It acts as a verbal storyboard and often describes the 'what' and 'where' of a scene. 
The female wordcloud points to more psychological and conversational words in the dialogue; this indicates investigation into the 'why' questions of a task, interacting with other characters. 
The male wordcloud shows functional words and goal-orientation. It contains both reflective language with resolution seeking.<br>
The verbs and adjectives gave more insight into the gendered use of vocabulary. The results will not be presented in this text, but can be found in the study.

#### Standardized Type Token Ratio
The standardized type token ratio was calculated as a measure for lexical richness of the dialogue. <br>
<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/corpus_analysis/sttr_boxplot-allgenders.png" alt="STTR" width="600"/> <br>
The plot shows a significant variance of the media (displayed in the plot in green) for the three groups. Diverse characters have the lowest median STTR value with around 4.5, followed by the female characters with 10, and the male character group at 12.5. Overall, the STTR shows that the lexical richness for diverse characters is lower than for female characters, and both of these groups show lower median values when compared to male characters. The long whiskers of the diverse group indicate a large spread of data, and the distribution of the IQR is not symmetrical around the median. This leads to the interpretation that diverse characters overall display lower STTR's, but the high variability means that there are some outliers. The whiskers for both female and male character groups are around the same length, indicating a similar variability of the measured value.


### Sentiment Analysis
The second part of the study used a one-shot transformer model to classify the utterances of the speakers.
The sentiment analysis was conducted using [this transformer model](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli). <br>
The analysis used the labels 'Positive', 'Neutral' and 'Negative. My goal was to investigate differences between the speech patterns between the three gender groups female, male, and diverse. <br>

Plots were created for each game, as the following example shows. These plots can also be found [here](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/tree/main/results/sentiment-analysis/plots/allgenders_sentiment).<br>

<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/sentiment-analysis/plots/allgenders_sentiment/sentiment_plot_kingsquest5.png" alt="sentiment analysis" width="500"> <br>
The plot shows an example sentiment analysis for one of the analyzed games, 'Kings Quest 5'. Over all games, some general trends have been identified with female characters dominating the highest mean scores for positive and male characters those for negative sentiments. There were however some outliers where female and male characters had only minimally differing scores, or the other gender group had the higher score of the two. The diverse character group had not the same linearity in their distribution. This is an indicator for the diverse characters not being modeled strictly after either one of the two genders in the binary model, and points towards an implementation of non-binarity as a fluid category, where characters are less constrained to a gendered performance that models either female or male patterns, but rather establishes new patterns or exists without many patterns at all. While this is not the case with all games, and some diverse representation still seems to follow one of the other groups in certain games, it is encouraging that those boundary-shifting representations can be surmised in a sentiment analysis of their dialogue in context with the game world they exist in.
Separate results for the sentiments of the three groups can be found [here](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/tree/main/results/sentiment-analysis/plots/separate-analysis-plots). The results are also saved as [.csv files](https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/tree/main/results/sentiment-analysis/csv-files).

### Emotion Detection
The same transformer model was also used to classify the utterances into emotions. I started with base emotions, modeled after [Paul Ekman](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Basic-Emotions.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwivlMrd1P2PAxV0A9sEHZ1cFKgQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0_mkacCbg1atn_MkjO3Yf2). The label 'Surprise' was kept initially, but it received very high scores across all games. This is not unexpected since the dialogue of RPGs is a main narrative drive, and new information is frequently presented using speech. Therefore, surprisal is expected, but it does not help me examine gendered differences. Therefore, in a second attempt, I left this label out, and here are the results.
#### Base Emotions
The following plot shows the mean frequency of the labels that have been assigned the highest scores in the classification, combined for all games. It is visible that 'Neutral' is the most frequent highest label, and that male characters have a lot more dialogue to get classified. <br>

The second plot shows the assigned mean scores (value between zero and one) for the emotion labels, combined for all games. Again, 'Neutral' receives the highest mean score, and 'Joy' and 'Disgust' the lowest, across all gender groups. This indicates a trend towards certain emotions, disregarding the speaker's gender.<br>

#### Experimental Labelset 1
After base analysis, I wanted to check for some more dynamics between female and male characters, and see if diverse characters lean more toward the classification of female or male dialogue. I therefore implemented experimental labelsets following some of the theories I had read, and tried to look at specific binary sets of labels. My theory was that if these labels would be assigned primarily to one gender, and their counterpart to another gender, that they had a very stereotypical, complementary set of gender roles. 
The labelset consisted of the labels:  Neutral, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Disgust.<br>
The following plot shows the mean frequency of the labels that have been assigned the highest scores in the classification, combined for all games. Male characters show the highest classification for sad and dominant utterances, the same holds for female characters. Generally, the classification trends hold across gender groups, indicating that a binary, complementary assignment of emotion in dialogue cannot be deducted. Dominant characters seem to fall out a little bit, but because they have less dialogue than the other character groups, this trend cannot be investigated without taking into account the small sample size.<br>

The second plot shows the assigned mean scores (value between zero and one) for the emotion labels, combined for all games. Here it is already visible that the diverse characters seem to receive a different kind of labeling than the rest.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/emotion-detection/plots/experimental-utterance-wise-labelset-1/all-gendergroups-compared/all_games_mean_scores_barplot.png" alt="Experimental labelset 1 mean" width="500"><br>


#### Experimental Labelset 2
The labelset consisted of the labels:  Neutral, Resistant, Receptive, Powerful, Gentle, Caring, Stoic, Dominant, Submissive.<br>
The following plot shows the mean frequency of the labels that have been assigned the highest scores in the classification, combined for all games. The plot shows that the most prominent labels are Powerful and Resistant, and their tuple pair labels Receptive and Gentle receive relatively low scores in comparison. <br>
<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/emotion-detection/plots/experimental-utterance-wise-labelset-2/all-gendergroups-compared/all_games_mean_percentage_barplot.png" alt="Experimental labelset 2 percentage" width="500"><br>
The second plot shows the assigned mean scores (value between zero and one) for the emotion labels, combined for all games.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/heidekrauttt/master-thesis/blob/main/results/emotion-detection/plots/experimental-utterance-wise-labelset-2/all-gendergroups-compared/all_games_mean_scores_barplot.png" alt="Experimental labelset 2 mean" width="500"><br>
Interestingly, in two cases the second most common label was 'Neutral' for the diverse characters, but this label never exceeded 15% for the other two character groups. Overall, the labels assigned to the diverse characters seemed to differ a lot depending on the game. The results show that the diverse characters don't seem to follow assigned roles in their dialogue across games, rather the characters that are present within a game get a certain dialogue role assigned. <br>

While the second experimental labelset did not yield in the diversification of labeling results we had hoped for, it nevertheless revealed some interesting insights into the dialogue that game characters speak. The emphasis on powerful, resistant characters that sometimes show receptive, dominant or even gentle tendencies is a representation of what emotions these characters are allowed to express within a hero-narrative and a task-driven context that is often present in role-playing video games. <br>


## Conclusion
The video games in the present corpus show clear differences between male characters and female and diverse characters in terms of dialogue. Investigating all present dialogue for the three gender groups over 19 games, male characters dominated games both in number and in dialogue lines. Masculine hegemony is portrayed by the male characters of the games through the statistical overpowering, establishing a dominance through presence and representation. Male characters show different lexical features than other characters, and use different vocabulary. The wordcloud analysis revealed that male characters exhibit linguistic habits that are in line with the more traditional, binary theories of masculinity, when transmitted to speech patterns. The overrepresentation of male characters and the omnipresence of male characters holds for all target groups, and is especially pronounced for the 'Teen' games, painting a concerning image on diverse representation in these games. The structures exhibited in the corpus are in line with the hegemonic framework of masculinities proposed by R.W. Connell: the close reading showed that male characters are in relation with one another and explicitly discuss hierarchies regarding their status, in contrast to female and diverse characters. <br>
Unfortunately, the diverse characters in the corpus make up only a small amount of the dialogue and there are few characters. All statistical values were therefore low. However, the diverse characters do not seem to follow conventional character design for males or females. They exhibit different vocabulary and take on different roles, expressing different emotions in different games. <br>
Female and diverse characters do not yet have an equal share of characters and storylines dedicated to them in video games. Fortunately, the industry is changing rapidly and many new games are released per year. One popular example is the successor of 'Hades', the game 'Hades II' was released in 2024 and features 'Melinoë' as a main character. She is the sister of the first game's main playable character 'Zagreus', showcasing how game series can impact representation of different characters in new game installations. Making non-male characters autonomous main characters in games is one way to increase visibility, change current dynamics in gaming, and work against the dominance of masculinity. <br>
